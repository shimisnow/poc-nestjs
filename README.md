# POC NestJS

This project explores the power of NestJS with this Proof of Concept (PoC) starter project. This repository serves as a demonstration of how to architect and develop a scalable backend application using NestJS. The PoC showcases best practices for creating modules, controllers, services, and integrating with databases. Additionally, it highlights the utilization of decorators and dependency injection to build a robust API foundation.

Key Features:

- Demonstrates NestJS architecture and patterns.
- Includes examples of modules, controllers, and services.
- Integrates with popular databases for data storage.
- Provides a strong foundation for building scalable APIs.
- Shows how to use OpenAPI documentation.
